# TouchBase Server Documentation

#### Backend deployed at [Heroku] (https://touch-base-server.herokuapp.com/) <br>

## Getting Started

To get the server running locally:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Touch-Base/TouchBaseServer.git`
2. `npm install`
3. Install PostgreSQL

- If you're on Mac:

4. `createdb touchbase` this creates the development database

- If you're on Windows:

5. a. Open pgadmin  
   b. Create database named `touchbase`

6. Run `npm run res` (which runs `npx knex migrate:latest` and `npx knex seed:run` )

## Available Scripts

- `npm start` to start the local server
- `npm start:dev` to start local server in development environment with nodemon
- `npm test` to run test suite once
- `npm run test:watch` to run test suite in watch mode
- `npm run migrate:latest` a convenient wrapper around knex
- `npm run seed:run` a convenient wrapper around knex
- `npm run migrate:test` runs migrations against the test database

# Data Model

üö´This is just an example. Replace this with your data model

<!--
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ ORGANIZATIONS

---

```
{
  id: UUID
  name: STRING
  industry: STRING
  paid: BOOLEAN
  customer_id: STRING
  subscription_id: STRING
}
```

}
``` -->

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Actions

üö´ This is an example, replace this with the actions that pertain to your backend

<!--
`getOrgs()` -> Returns all organizations

`getOrg(orgId)` -> Returns a single organization by ID

`addOrg(org)` -> Returns the created org

`updateOrg(orgId)` -> Update an organization by ID

`deleteOrg(orgId)` -> Delete an organization by ID
<br>
<br>
<br>
`getUsers(orgId)` -> if no param all users

`getUser(userId)` -> Returns a single user by user ID

`addUser(user object)` -> Creates a new user and returns that user. Also creates 7 availabilities defaulted to hours of operation for their organization.

`updateUser(userId, changes object)` -> Updates a single user by ID.

`deleteUser(userId)` -> deletes everything dependent on the user
-->

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:

<!-- will we have a STAGING_DB?
    *  STAGING_DB - optional development db for using functionality
-->

```
PORT=4000         // Port number for express server to run on
NODE_ENV          // set to "development" until ready for "production"
DB_HOST=localhost // Location of the database
DB_PORT=5432      // Port the database is running on
DB_USER=postgres  // THIS IS YOUR LOCAL DB USER NAME (probably postgres)
DB_PASSWORD=pass  // THIS IS YOUR LOCAL DATABASE/PSQL PASSWORD
DB_NAME=propman   // THIS IS YOUR LOCAL DATABASE NAME

TEST_DB_HOST=localhost
TEST_DB_PORT=5432
TEST_DB_USER=postgres
TEST_DB_PASSWORD=postgres
TEST_DB_NAME=propman-test

GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=./firebase/admin.json
FIREBASE_URL=example-url
FIREBASE_API_KEY=examplekey
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=exampleapp.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=exampledb.firebaseio.com
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=example-project
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=exmaple.appspot.com
FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=1234
FIREBASE_APP_ID=1234
FIREABASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=example-g-id

JWT_SECRET="Your Secret." // you can generate this by using a python shell or add in a temporary secret.
```

<!-- Currently not using Sendgrid or Stripe at this time
  *  SENDGRID_API_KEY - this is generated in your Sendgrid account
  *  stripe_secret - this is generated in the Stripe dashboard
